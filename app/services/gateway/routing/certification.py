"""Model certification registry (M9, plan section 21).

Routing Invariant (plan section 1): production traffic may only reach
models that have passed the required evaluation/certification gates --
"including fallback traffic" (plan section 13). Before this module
existed, route_sets.yaml's own docstring admitted that wasn't actually
enforced anywhere: "'Certified' here just means 'listed in this
file'". This closes that gap -- CertifiedRouter (routing/router.py)
filters every candidate, primary and fallback alike, against this
registry, and pipeline.enforce_model_certification rejects an
uncertified primary before the router is ever reached.

evals/run_eval.py is what actually produces
policies/certified_models.yaml's entries, by running a golden dataset
against a model and checking it clears plan section 21's release gate
(quality/safety/latency/cost thresholds) -- this module only loads and
exposes the result of that process, it doesn't run evaluations itself.
