"""Model governance registry (plan section 34.5).

`routing/certification.py` (M9) already implements the critique's
"platform governance controls whether a model enters production, not
gateway-side ML evaluation" -- evals/run_eval.py runs the release gate,
`certified_models.yaml` is its output, the gateway only reads it. What
that file *doesn't* carry is governance richness: owner, risk
classification, approved use cases, region, max data classification,
retirement date, or a lifecycle richer than "present or absent."

This is a deliberately SEPARATE overlay, keyed by the same model_id as
`certified_models.yaml` -- eval results and governance curation are
different concerns maintained by different people/processes; merging
them into one file would mean a governance-only edit (retiring a
model) has to touch a file that's otherwise machine-written by
evals/run_eval.py.

A model absent from the registry is treated as APPROVED (permissive
default) -- so introducing this file doesn't silently break every
pre-existing certified model that hasn't been curated into it yet.
