"""Certified model router (M4, plan section 13).

Wraps the retry-capable ConverseClient (BedrockClient already does
bounded retry + exponential backoff + jitter per call, from M0) with a
circuit breaker and fallback across a *certified* route set -- fallback
candidates always come from `policies/route_sets.yaml`, never an
arbitrary or unevaluated model. A tenant with no route_set assigned (or
one that resolves to no configured fallbacks) gets exactly one candidate
-- the model resolved by `pipeline.enforce_model_allowlist` -- so it
behaves like a direct call, M0's original behavior.
