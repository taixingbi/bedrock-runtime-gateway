"""Request-scoped context: request_id + session_id + duration_ms tracking.

Every request gets a request_id (reused from the `X-Request-Id` inbound
header when the caller supplied one, so it survives retries/proxies;
otherwise generated here). It is stashed on `request.state.request_id`,
exposed via a ContextVar for code that doesn't have the Request object
handy, echoed back on the response, and used to correlate every log line
for that request.

session_id works the same way except it's never invented when absent
(read from `X-Session-Id`, empty if the caller didn't send one) -- a
random session_id wouldn't actually group anything, unlike request_id
where any unique value is useful. api_gateway_request_id is the same
idea again, but read from `X-Apigw-Request-Id` -- platform-edge-gateway
maps its own `$context.requestId` onto this header explicitly (not
something AWS adds by itself, and not a header any client sets); the
join key back to that repo's own access log (see telemetry/logging.py's
module docstring for the full picture).

This middleware also opens the OUTER span for the whole request
(everything downstream, including route handlers' own child spans,
nests under it) -- the *reason* being that this is also where the
`gateway.access` "request completed" line gets logged, in the
`finally` block, and JsonFormatter (telemetry/logging.py) only picks
up trace_id/span_id from whatever span is current *at log time*. A
route handler's own span has already ended by the time this runs, so
without a span opened here, gateway.access lines would never carry
trace_id/span_id at all. Skipped for /healthz -- polled every 10-15s
forever, and X-Ray bills per trace recorded, so a span (and CloudWatch
cost) for those pings would be pure waste.
